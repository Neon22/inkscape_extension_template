inkscape_extension_template
===========================

An explicit inkscape template to be modified to make new extensions.

Making a new extension in inkscape requires a UI.
There are many fine extensions to use as examples but no single extension shows all the useful features.
This extension shows example parameters to cut and paste as well as a useful tab layout incorporating help.
