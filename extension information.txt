Languages
Extensions can be in python or other languages.
e.g.

Subclassing
The majority of extensions subclass inkex.Effect
but some subclass other classes.

E.g.
color_blackandwhite subclasses coloreffect.ColorEffect

Object type
- all, path, rect, g
e.g. rect = funcplot, jessyInk_view
e.g. g = jessyInk_summary
e.g. all = the color extensions



Use case examples:

color_blackandwhite
- which is not interactive
- recolors currrent selection (or entire doc if no selection) to black and white.
- subclasses coloreffect.ColorEffect
  - which is defined in another extension coloreffect.py
     (where it subclasses inkex.Effect)
  - The inx file adds this as an executable dependency so it can refer to it



dots:
- indicate in UI that it operates on a selected path
- copy the path first so is non-destructive
